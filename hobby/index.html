			<p>My name is William Edwin Hemric, but I usually go by just Will. I was born in Jonesville, North Carolina, where I was one day given a hand-me-down Super Nintendo Entertainment System from my dad. Ever since that day, I've had a passionate interest and fascination with video games. I've played thousands of games and even created my own. I am currently studying at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte to earn a degree in Computer Science with a major in Robotics, AI, and Gaming.</p>

			<h2>Fire Emblem Engage</h2>
			<p>Best Gameplay Yet, Worst Writing Yet</p>
			<figure>
				<img id="photoEngageScreen" class="mainPageImage" src="images/screenshot-engage-1.jpg">

			</figure>
			<p>I actually had taken a break from the Fire Emblem series for a while before picking up this game. Fates, the final release on Nintendo 3DS, left a bad taste in my mouth. Not with the gameplay, mind you, as I would consider Fates to be a top-notch strategy game from a mechanical and design standpoint. Instead, I found Fates' writing absolutely insufferably forced and without any earned payoffs for any threads that the writers attempt to sew into the overarching narrative. To use less preachy words, it felt corny. Very, very corny.</p>
			<p>In all honesty, I have no idea what compelled me to pick up Engage, but I'm glad I did. I would argue that this is some of the most interesting strategy gameplay the series has ever seen, with the most ever options for customizing and building your units to develop unique strategies on every playthrough. Maddening mode feels incredibly refined to let you use every new unit effectively in the Chapter they are introduced in. Nearly every game mechanic feels thoroughly considered and tested to perfection. If the only thing you care about in this series is the gameplay, you can stop reading here and pick the game up.</p>
			<p>However, if you also care in any way about the Fire Emblem franchise's storytelling and writing, this game becomes a hard sell. Fire Emblem Engage is intended as a celebration of the series' anniversary, with 12 returning protagonists from previous games helping the new cast in their quest. Not only do these shells of their prior selves barely call back or use their own experiences, but they still end up being the most enjoyable parts of the game's story simply because of how one-note every new character feels. Whether intended as a parody of the series tropes or not, rapid-fire blasting through every single trope and calling it a story feels a bit insulting.</p>
			<p>That's about all I have to say on this game, really. I would hard recommend it in terms of its customization and gameplay, but the writing is genuinely really terrible.</p>

			<h2>Splatoon 3</h2>
			<p>Least necessary, most refined</p>
			<figure>
				<img id="photoSplat3Screen" class="mainPageImage" src="images/screenshot-splat3-1.jpg">
				<figcaption>Screenshot from nintendolife.com</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Splatoon 2 was a game that steadily became more and more bloated with "quantity over quality" to the point that any new player would be terrified to pick the game up. In its current state at the time of this writing, Splatoon 3 feels much more condensed and thoughtful in its approach to game balance and variety. The main issue I would cite so far is that updates have a tendency to add content favoring shooter class weapons, while not much exists for other weapon types, including the newly added Splatana and Stringer weapon types which have still not had a single addition to their lineup since launch.</p>
			<p>The story mode has also gotten a significant overhaul. I don't want to spoil the glow-up from the first two games, but know you will get a lot more out of the campaign than you ever have with these games.</p>

			<h2>Stardew Valley</h2>
			<p>This game nearly hurt my grades from time wasted.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/screenshot-stardew-1.jpg" class="mainPageImage">
				<figcaption>Screenshot from rpgfan.com</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>This is singlehandedly the most a game has ever sucked me into its world by far. I would spend hours at a time completely engrossed in its world and never looking around my surroundings.</p>
			<p>This is to say, Stardew Valley is an absolutely enchanting experience. The way that it constantly invokes the sense of "Just let me do this one more thing and I'll stop for today" means that my college grades nearly suffered a few times before I was satisfied enough to tap out. If you want something to do over a summer period, or any other free month or so, check out Stardew Valley.</p>
